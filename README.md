# JavaLoginPage2.0
This is an update version of my previous Login Page
I made use of Java's file storing mechanisms to enable the new User Button in the login Page
I also edited it to ensure the code's conciseness and readability
The Id and passwords are stored in a file called accounts.txt
Note: The code is free for anyone to use, but please give me some credit, and do not plagiarize on your github profile.
